                            important to establish what you can expect from us as you use 
                            Identtii, and what we expect from you. This Terms reflect the way 
                            our platform works, and define our relationship with you as you 
                            interact with our services. For example, these terms include the

                            Our platform is merely a directory that lists individuals or 
                            organisations that are notorious for being unavailable or 
                            unreachable to complete a deal they once opted in for. 
                            In a bid to protect the community from such ones, 
                            we will keep maintaining a database of such ones, 
                            available for query using their email, phone number, 
                            name or Bank Verification Number (BVN). 
                            As we seek partnerships with third-party 
                            organizations, we will try to ensure that 
                            this directory impacts on the lives of those 
                            listed there, so much so that they are willing 
                            to make amends in their forfeited business deals.

                            In addition to our website and mobile app, we will provide 
                            Application Programming Interface (API) to organizations that 
                            wish to integrate our search product. These terms of use and the 
                            applicable agreements we have with such organizations will govern 
                            the use of our APIs.

                            The content listings on Identtii directory are the exclusive properties of the organization that uploaded them. 
                            In the spirit of mutual concern, these organizations agree to share 
                            such contents with the general public and fellow organizations in other to protect them from a similar default. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the general public, we will display certain sensitive, private data 
                            including phone number, email, and BVN as masked. Verified and registered 
                            organizations will however, have a full view of these data to enable them 
                            make stringent business decisions

                            Although, it is the responsibility of each organization to delete its listings 
                            whenever necessary, Identtii may delete listings with questionable eligibility.

                            When you get a notice that you will be listed on Identtii, and you want 
                            to contest that action, we have provided you with appropriate prompts 
                            to handle that situation. Once you reconnect with the organization

                            the directory. This will reconnect you with the organization(s) that enlisted
